## üì¢ Latest Updates
- **Feb-13-25**- Technical report of SB-Bench is released on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08779)! üî•üî•
- **Feb-13-25**- *SB-Bench Dataset* and codes are released. It provides 7,500 visually grounded, non-synthetic multiple-choice QA samples across 9 social bias categories to extensively evaluate the performance of LMMs. üî•üî•

---
## Setup
<p align="justify"> The evaluation code can be found under Evaluation directory.

To run the code, first install dependencies from `requirements_1.txt` and `requirements_2.txt` in separate envorinments. The environment from `requirements_1.txt` can run all the LMMs except InternVL. 

Run this in your terminal to install all the dependencies listed in requirements_1:
</p>
<pre>pip install -r requirements_1.txt</pre>

## Inference

### Real World Images
<p align="justify"> 

Activate the environment and edit `HF_TOKEN` in the `Evaluation/run_inference_batch.py` file.

To run Open Ended inference, use:

<pre>python run_inference_batch.py -m "MODEL_NAME" --batch-size BATCH_SIZE --output-path "OUTPUT_PATH" --remove-options</pre>

Replace MODEL_NAME, BATCH_SIZE, and OUTPUT_PATH with your desired values. 


To run MCQ inference, use:

<pre>python run_inference_batch.py -m "MODEL_NAME" --batch-size BATCH_SIZE --output-path "OUTPUT_PATH" </pre>

Replace MODEL_NAME, BATCH_SIZE, and OUTPUT_PATH with your desired values. The parameters can be left as it is, by default is loads `llava-one-vision-7B` model with batch_size as `64` and output path as `outputs/`.

</p>

### Synthetic Images
<p align="justify"> 

Activate the environment and edit `HF_TOKEN` in the `Evaluation/run_inference_batch_synthetic.py` file.

To run Open Ended inference, use:

<pre>python run_inference_batch_synthetic.py -m "MODEL_NAME" --batch-size BATCH_SIZE --output-path "OUTPUT_PATH" --remove-options</pre>

Replace MODEL_NAME, BATCH_SIZE, and OUTPUT_PATH with your desired values. 


To run MCQ inference, use:

<pre>python run_inference_batch_synthetic.py -m "MODEL_NAME" --batch-size BATCH_SIZE --output-path "OUTPUT_PATH" </pre>

Replace MODEL_NAME, BATCH_SIZE, and OUTPUT_PATH with your desired values. The parameters can be left as it is, by default is loads `llava-one-vision-7B` model with batch_size as `64` and output path as `outputs/`.

</p>

## Evaluation/Scoring
### Real World Images
<p>
To evaluate the *RuA* of different models, first enter your Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint in the <i>Evaluation/scoring/main/oe or mcq</i>  01, 02, 03, 04 files and run them in the order by following commands:
</p>
<pre>python 01_filter.py --base_path "BASE_PATH"
python 02_submit_file.py
python 03_submit_job.py
python 04_retrieve.py
python 05_merge.py --base_path "BASE_PATH"
</pre>

The BASE_PATH is the output folder of inference results of LMMs. If it is left blank then the code considers `outputs/lmm_outputs` directory.

After this, run `detailed_get_scores.py` in the *Evaluation/scoring/main/* directory:
<pre>python detailed_get_scores.py</pre>

### Synthetic Images
To evaluate the *RuA* of different models, first enter your Azure OpenAI API key and endpoint in the <i>Evaluation/scoring/synthetic/oe or mcq</i>  01, 02, 03, 04 files and run them in the order by following commands:
</p>
<pre>python 01_filter.py --base_path "BASE_PATH"
python 02_submit_file.py
python 03_submit_job.py
python 04_retrieve.py
python 05_merge.py --base_path "BASE_PATH"
</pre>

The BASE_PATH is the output folder of inference results of LMMs. If it is left blank then the code considers `outputs/lmm_outputs_synthetic` directory.

After this, run `detailed_get_scores.py` in the *Evaluation/scoring/synthetic/* directory:
<pre>python detailed_get_scores.py</pre>

## üèÜ Highlights

<p align="center">
  <img src="Assets/piechart.png" alt="main figure" width="400"/>
</p>

> <p align="justify"> <b> <span style="color: blue;">Figure</span>:The SB-Bench includes nine diverse domains and 54 sub-domains to rigorously assess the performance of LMMs in visually grounded stereotypical scenarios. SB-Bench comprises over 14.5k questions on carefully curated non-synthetic images.

> **<p align="justify"> Abstract:** *Stereotype biases in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) perpetuate harmful societal prejudices, undermining the fairness and equity of AI applications. As LMMs grow increasingly influential, addressing and mitigating inherent biases related to stereotypes, harmful generations, and ambiguous assumptions in real-world scenarios has become essential. However, existing datasets evaluating stereotype biases in LMMs often lack diversity and rely on synthetic images, leaving a gap in bias evaluation for real-world visual contexts. To address the gap in bias evaluation using real images, we introduce the* **Stereotype Bias Benchmark** (**SBbench**), *the most comprehensive framework to date for assessing stereotype biases across nine diverse categories and 54 sub-categories with non-synthetic images.* **SBbench** *contains 14,578 image-question pairs and rigorously evaluates LMMs through carefully curated, visually grounded scenarios, challenging them to reason accurately about visual stereotypes. It offers a robust evaluation framework featuring real-world visual samples, image variations, and open-ended question formats. By introducing visually grounded queries that isolate visual biases from textual ones,* **SBbench** *enables a precise and nuanced assessment of a model‚Äôs reasoning capabilities across varying levels of difficulty. Through rigorous testing of 16 state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source LMMs,* **SBbench** *provides a systematic approach to assessing stereotype biases in LMMs across key social dimensions. We further curate and perform comparisons with synthetic images to highlight the distribution shift when evaluated against real-world visual samples. This benchmark represents a significant step toward fostering fairness in AI systems and reducing harmful biases, laying the groundwork for more equitable and socially responsible LMMs.*
 </p>

## `SB-Bench` provides a more rigorous and standardized evaluation framework for next-generation multilingual LMMs.

**Main contributions:**
The contributions of our work can be summarized as follows:

- We introduce **SBbench**, a diverse open-ended benchmark featuring *14,578* non-synthetic visual samples that span across nine categories and 54 sub-categories of social biases, providing a more accurate reflection of real-world contexts.
- **SBbench** is meticulously designed to present visually grounded scenarios, explicitly disentangling visual biases from textual biases. This enables a focused and precise evaluation of visual stereotypes in LMMs.
- We benchmark 16 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LMMs, along with their various scale variants on **SBbench**. Our analysis highlights critical challenges and provides actionable insights for developing more equitable and fair multimodal models.
- We further compare our experimental setup against synthetic images and closed-ended evaluations, highlighting distribution shift and selection bias, respectively.

## üîç Dataset Annotation Process
![main figure](Assets/multimodal_bias_pipeline.png)
> <p align="justify"> <b> <span style="color: blue;">Figure</span></b>: `SB-Bench` pipeline: Our benchmark incorporates ambiguous contexts and bias-probing questions from the BBQ dataset. The ambiguous text context is passed to a Visual Query Generator (VQG), which simplifies it into a search-friendly query to retrieve real-world images from the web. Retrieved images are filtered through a three-stage process: (1) PaddleOCR is used to eliminate text-heavy images; (2) semantic alignment is verified using CLIP, Qwen2.5-VL, and GPT-4o-mini to ensure the image matches the simplified context; and (3) synthetic and cartoon-like images are removed using GPT-4o-mini. A Visual Information Remover (VIR) anonymizes text references to prevent explicit leakage. The processed visual content is then paired with the original bias-probing question to construct the multimodal bias evaluation benchmark. </p>

## üìä Results
![main figure](Assets/results.png)
> <p align="justify"> <b> <span style="color: blue;">Table</span></b>: Evaluation of open-source and proprietary LMMs on demographic fairness metrics. Higher scores indicate more fair (non-stereotypical) outputs across demographic categories. </p>

![main figure](Assets/failures.png)
> <p align="justify"> <b> <span style="color: blue;">Figure</span></b>: We present qualitative examples from three LMMs‚ÄîGPT-4o, Phi-4-Multimodal, and Qwen2.5-VL‚Äîshowcasing failure cases across various stereotype categories in SB-bench. Rather than responding with ‚Äúcannot be determined‚Äù when faced with ambiguous or insufficient information, models often rely on stereotypical associations to make definitive choices. For instance, Qwen2.5-VL (bottom-left) infers that a hijab-wearing woman is against terrorism, and GPT-4o (top-right) assumes a woman carrying a handbag is a secretary‚Äîboth reflecting bias-driven reasoning rather than grounded inference. These examples highlight how current LMMs tend to amplify or reproduce social stereotypes when interpreting vague or context-light scenarios. </p>

![main figure](Assets/synthetic_cases.png)
> <p align="justify"> <b> <span style="color: blue;">Figure</span></b>: We present qualitative examples from our synthetically generated VQA pairs to highlight the limitations of current generative models, even after filtering. As shown in (right), the image generated by Stable-Diffusion-3.5-Large [26 ] was intended to depict a Catholic man and a Muslim man; however, both figures display Christian symbols, revealing a failure to accurately represent distinct religious identities. Similarly, the generated image in (center) was meant to portray a woman with a prosthetic leg and a woman with Down syndrome, but it exhibits visual inaccuracies in both prosthetic design and facial depiction, resulting in ambiguous and potentially misleading representations of disability. Notably, these generations passed through our two-stage filtering process (CLIP similarity and GPT-4o-mini filtering), yet still yielded unsatisfactory and unrealistic outputs.. </p>
